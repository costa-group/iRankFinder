  <h3> Others tools experiments:</h3>
  <p>We have also analyzed this set of benchmarks using other
    termination analyzers of ITSs: <a href="" target="_blank">VeryMax</a> and <a href="" target="_blank">T2</a>. There are 8 (resp. 14) examples that we can handle due to the use of CFR and
VeryMax (resp. T2) cannot handle without CFR. For benchmarks where VeryMax (resp. T2) failed, we have applied them again on the ITSs after CFR (using scheme CFR<span class="foot">B</span>) and it could prove termination of 6 (resp. 36) more benchmarks and nontermination of 76 (resp. 36)
    benchmarks.</p>
