<h3 id="term"> CFR for Termination Analysis </h3> 

<p>We have evaluated the effect of Algorithm 2 on i<span class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">R<span class="small-caps">ank</span>F<span class="small-caps">inder</span>,
comparing the results of i<span class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">R<span class="small-caps">ank</span>F<span class="small-caps">inder</span> with and without CFR using
different settings. And we also compared to other termination analysis
  tools. We have used sets <span class="cmtt-12">TPDB-A</span>, <span class="cmtt-12">TPDB-B</span> and <span class="cmtt-12">TPDB-C</span>, but excluded
  benchmarks known to be non-terminating: 151 for <span class="cmtt-12">TPDB-A</span>, 93 for <span class="cmtt-12">TPDB-B</span>
  and 93 for <span class="cmtt-12">TPDB-C</span>.</p>

<p>We first analysed all benchmarks for termination without CFR in two settings: using
only LRFs; and using LLRFs with the definition of nested QLRF of Section 5.1.4 and
d = 3. For those on which i<span class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">R<span class="small-caps">ank</span>F<span class="small-caps">inder</span> failed to prove termination, we analysed them
again with CFR using different sets of properties and CFR schemes. The results for LRFs
  and LLRFs are summarised in the following tables.</p>
<div id="termin-lrf-table" include-html="cfr-termin-table-lrf.html"/>
<div id="termin-llrf-table" include-html="cfr-termin-table-llrf.html"/>


<p class="indent">   Both tables consist of 3 (vertical) blocks, one for each set of benchmarks. On the right side
of each block, we indicate: the total number of benchmarks on which i<span class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">R<span class="small-caps">ank</span>F<span class="small-caps">inder</span> </span> </span>succeeded
and failed <span class="cmti-12">without </span>CFR (excluding non-terminating ones), and the corresponding total time in
minutes; and the additional number of benchmarks on which i<span class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">R<span class="small-caps">ank</span>F<span class="small-caps">inder</span> </span> </span>succeeded when
using CFR. For example: in the first block of Table 1, the last column indicates that
i<span class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">R<span class="small-caps">ank</span>F<span class="small-caps">inder</span> </span> </span>succeeded (resp. failed) on 159 (resp. 106) benchmarks and the total analysis
time was 8<span class="cmmi-12">.</span>16min (resp. 15<span class="cmmi-12">.</span>75min); and that when using CFR it succeeds on additional 40
benchmarks. For each set, columns correspond to different CFR schemes, and rows to properties used for
CFR:

<p class="nopar"> Each entry in the tables includes the number of benchmarks that i<span class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">R<span class="small-caps">ank</span>F<span class="small-caps">inder</span> </span> </span>can now
prove terminating, and the total time it took to analyse all benchmarks, using the scheme and
properties as indicated in the corresponding row and column. Each benchmark was given a 5
minutes time limit. In terms of precision:

<p class="noindent">In total, out of 609 (resp. 188) benchmarks that i<span class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">R<span class="small-caps">ank</span>F<span class="small-caps">inder</span> </span> </span>cannot prove terminating without
CFR using LRFs (resp. LLRFs), with CFR it proves terminating of 312 (resp. 72) more

<p class="indent">   Times in the tables, however, should be interpreted carefully, since when analysing <span class="cmti-12">without</span>
CFR and when using <span class="cmtt-12">CFR</span><span class="cmtt-8">B</span> the analysis stops as soon as it fails to prove termination of a
SCC, while when using <span class="cmtt-12">CFR</span><span class="cmtt-8">S</span> and <span class="cmtt-12">CFR</span><span class="cmtt-8">A</span> it keeps trying to prove termination of other
SCCs.

<p class="indent">   We have also compared to other termination analysers of TSs: <span class="cmtt-12">VeryMax</span> and <span class="cmtt-12">T2</span>. The
results are summarised in tables 3 and 4. Note that these tables include two versions of
i<span class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">R<span class="small-caps">ank</span>F<span class="small-caps">inder</span> </span></span>: with and without CFR. Table 3 includes the total number of benchmarks for
which each tool could prove terminating. We can see that, in total, i<span class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">R<span class="small-caps">ank</span>F<span class="small-caps">inder</span> </span> </span>with CFR
could prove termination of more examples than any other tool. Table&nbsp; 4 includes a more
detailed comparison. The number <span class="cmmi-12">x </span>at row <span class="cmmi-12">i </span>and column <span class="cmmi-12">j </span>is the number of benchmarks for
which tool <span class="cmmi-12">i </span>could prove termination and tool <span class="cmmi-12">j </span>could not. We can see that the column of
i<span class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">R<span class="small-caps">ank</span>F<span class="small-caps">inder</span> </span> </span>with CFR has the lowest numbers, i.e., it is the one that loses less
precision.
