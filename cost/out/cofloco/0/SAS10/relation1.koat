Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [stop/5]
1. non_recursive  : [lbl41/5]
2. non_recursive  : [start/5]
3. non_recursive  : [start0/5]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into start0/5

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations start0/5 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [2] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start0/5 
* CEs [2] --> Loop 2 

### Ranking functions of CR start0(A,B,C,D,F) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start0(A,B,C,D,F) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of start0(A,B,C,D,F):
* Chain [2]: 3
  with precondition: [] 


Closed-form bounds of start0(A,B,C,D,F): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [2] with precondition: [] 
    - Upper bound: 3 
    - Complexity: constant 

### Maximum cost of start0(A,B,C,D,F): 3 
Asymptotic class: constant
