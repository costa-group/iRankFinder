Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [merge/3]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [merge_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [start/3]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into merge/3
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into start/3

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations merge/3 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [7] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of merge/3 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 7 

### Ranking functions of CR merge(A,B,C) 
* RF of phase [5,6]: [A+B-1]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR merge(A,B,C) 
* Partial RF of phase [5,6]:
  - RF of loop [5:1]:
    A
  - RF of loop [6:1]:
    B


### Specialization of cost equations start/3 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [8] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/3 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 8 

### Ranking functions of CR start(A,B,C) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(A,B,C) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of merge(A,B,C):
* Chain [[5,6],7]: 2*it(5)+0
  Such that:aux(3) =< A+B
it(5) =< aux(3)

  with precondition: [C=2,A>=1,B>=1] 

* Chain [7]: 0
  with precondition: [C=2] 


#### Cost of chains of start(A,B,C):
* Chain [8]: 2*s(4)+1
  Such that:s(3) =< A+B
s(4) =< s(3)

  with precondition: [] 


Closed-form bounds of start(A,B,C): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [8] with precondition: [] 
    - Upper bound: nat(A+B)*2+1 
    - Complexity: n 

### Maximum cost of start(A,B,C): nat(A+B)*2+1 
Asymptotic class: n
