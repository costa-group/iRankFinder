Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [n_eval___1/3]
1. non_recursive  : [n_eval___2/3]
2. non_recursive  : [n_start/3]
3. non_recursive  : [pyRinit/3]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into pyRinit/3

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations pyRinit/3 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [2] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of pyRinit/3 
* CEs [2] --> Loop 2 

### Ranking functions of CR pyRinit(A,B,C) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR pyRinit(A,B,C) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of pyRinit(A,B,C):
* Chain [2]: 3
  with precondition: [A>=B+1] 


Closed-form bounds of pyRinit(A,B,C): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [2] with precondition: [A>=B+1] 
    - Upper bound: 3 
    - Complexity: constant 

### Maximum cost of pyRinit(A,B,C): 3 
Asymptotic class: constant
